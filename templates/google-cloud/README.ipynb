    "Note: this tutorial requires Ploomber 0.19.2 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show how you can use Google Cloud and Ploomber to develop a scalable and production-ready pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use Google BigQuery (data warehouse) and Cloud Storage to show how we can transform big datasets with ease using SQL, plot the results with Python, and store the results in the cloud. Thanks to BigQuery scalability (we'll use a dataset with 5.5M records!) and Ploomber's convenience, **the entire process from importing the data to the summary report is on the cloud takes less than 20 seconds!**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, I'll quickly go over two Google Cloud services we use for this project. [Google BigQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery) is a serverless data warehouse that allows us to analyze data at scale. In simpler terms, we can store massive datasets and query using SQL without managing servers. On the other hand, [Google Cloud Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Storage) is a storage service; it is the equivalent service to Amazon S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our analysis comprises SQL and Python, we use [Ploomber](https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber), an open-source framework to write maintainable pipelines. It abstracts all the details, so we focus on writing the SQL and Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the data. We'll be using a public dataset that contains statistics of people's names in the US over time. The dataset contains 5.5M records. Here's what it looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![data](images/data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now take a look at the pipeline's architecture!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Architecture overview\n",
    "\n",
    "![architecture](images/architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is the `create-table.sql` script; such script runs a `CREATE TABLE` statement to copy a public dataset. `create-view.sql` and `create-materialized-view.sql` use the existing table and generate a view and a materialized view (their purpose is to show how we can create other types of SQL relations, we don't use the outputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dump-table.sql` queries the existing table, and it dumps the results into a local file. Then, the `plot.py` Python script uses the local data file, generates a plot, and uploads it in HTML format to Cloud Storage. The whole process may seem intimidating, but Ploomber makes this straightforward!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now configure the cloud services we'll use!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to create a bucket in Cloud Storage and a dataset in BigQuery; the following sections explain how to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloud Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the [Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage) console (select a project or create a new one, if needed) and create a new bucket (you may use an existing one if you prefer so). In our case, we'll create a bucket \"ploomber-bucket\" under the project \"ploomber\":\n",
    "\n",
    "![create-bucket](images/storage-create-bucket.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, enter a name (in our case \"ploomber-bucket\"), and click on \"CREATE\":\n",
    "\n",
    "![confirm](images/storage-confirm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now configure BigQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "## BigQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) console and create a dataset. To do so, click on the three stacked dots next to your project's name and then click on \"Create dataset\":\n",
    "\n",
    "![create](images/bigquery-create.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, enter \"my_dataset\" as the Dataset ID and \"us\" in *Data location* (location\n",
    "is important since we'll be using a public dataset located in such region),\n",
    "then click on \"CREATE DATASET\":\n",
    "\n",
    "![create](images/bigquery-confirm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Cloud is ready now! Let's now configure our local environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's authenticate so we can make API calls to Google Cloud. Ensure\n",
    "you authenticate with an account that has enough permissions in the project\n",
