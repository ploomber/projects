# Pipeline from a directory

<!-- start description -->
Create a pipeline from a directory with scripts (without a pipeline.yaml file).
<!-- end description -->

## Build

```bash
mkdir output
ploomber build --entry-point '*.py'
```

Output stored in the `output/` directory.


## Describe

This pipeline contains five steps. The last task trains a model and outputs a
report and a model file. To get the pipeline description:

```bash
ploomber status --entry-point '*.py'
```

`--entry-point '*.py'` means "all files with py extension are tasks in the
pipeline". If all the files in the current directory are tasks, you can also
use the shortcut `--entry-point .`.
