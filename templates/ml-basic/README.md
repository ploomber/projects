# Basic ML project

Machine Learning pipeline.

## Description

Let's take a look at the `pipeline.yaml`:

<!-- #md -->
```yaml
# Content of pipeline.yaml
# # enable client if you want to upload arfifacts to google cloud storage
# # see clients.py for details
# clients:
#   File:
#     dotted_path: clients.get_storage_client
#     run_id: '{{run_id}}'

tasks:
    # tasks.get, features and join are python functions
  - source: tasks.get
    product: output/get.parquet

  - source: tasks.features
    product: output/features.parquet

  - source: tasks.join
    product: output/join.parquet

    # fit.py is a script executed as a notebook
  - source: fit.py
    name: fit
    product:
        nb: output/nb.ipynb
        model: output/model.pickle

```
<!-- #endmd -->

Note that the first three tasks as Python functions, while the last one is a
script.

Generate the plot:

```bash
ploomber plot
```

```python
# If using jupyter, you can show the plot with this code:
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename='pipeline.png')

# otherwise open the pipeline.png file directly
```

## Build pipeline

```bash
ploomber build
```

Since the training task is a script, it will generate a Jupyter notebook at
[output/nb.ipynb](output/nb.ipynb) with evaluation charts.

## Interacting with the pipeline

The command line interface is a convenient way to interact with your
pipeline. Try this in a terminal:

~~~bash
ploomber interact
~~~
