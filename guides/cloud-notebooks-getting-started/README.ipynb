    "# Getting Started with Cloud Notebooks API\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how you can execute notebooks in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Ploomber Cloud, you can run notebooks in parallel, and you can even request more resources (CPU, memory, GPU) and more!\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will be covered in this tutorial. **(You can click any of them to jump directly to the corresponding section.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will help you setup your local environment to run notebooks in Ploomber Cloud. Basically, you only need to install Ploomber and set the API Key from your Ploomber Cloud account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Ploomber\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the updated version of Ploomber, open a terminal and run the following command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install ploomber --upgrade\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the Ploomber Cloud API key\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, you'll need to sign in to [Ploomber Cloud](https://www.cloud.ploomber.io/signin.html). Once you sign in, jou just need to copy your API key and run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "ploomber cloud set-key {your-key}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed tutorial to get and set your API Key can be found [here](https://docs.ploomber.io/en/latest/cloud/api-key.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook submission to Ploomber Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "For this simple example, we will use a notebook that draws random numbers with `numpy` and plots them with `matplotlib`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> To make it more interesting, we will use these random numbes to estimate a value of pi using the [Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). (This is just to make a simple example more interesting, but in any case, the important part is just to see how this example will allow you to run the notebook directly in Ploober Cloud.) \n",
    "> <center><img src=\"https://github.com/ploomber/projects/raw/master/guides/cloud-notebook-simple/plot.png\" width=\"70%\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to download the sample notebook we have prepared to your local folder. To do so, you just need to run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ploomber/projects/master/guides/cloud-notebook-simple/plot.ipynb -o plot.ipynb\n",
