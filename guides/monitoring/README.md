## Get a sample pipeline

<!-- start description -->
To show the capabilities we'll run our pipeline monitoring through a pre-built Ploomber template: ml-basic.
<!-- end description -->

```bash
ploomber plot
```

```python
# If using jupyter, you can show the plot with this code:
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename='pipeline.png')
# otherwise open the pipeline.png file directly

# NOTE: ploomber plot will generate a pipeline.html (not .png) file if
# pygraphviz is missing. In such case, open the file to view the pipeline plot
```

Let's take a look at the `pipeline.yaml`:

<!-- #md -->
```yaml
# Content of pipeline.yaml
tasks:
  - source: tasks.get
    product: output/get.parquet

  - source: tasks.features
    product: output/features.parquet

  - source: tasks.join
    product: output/join.parquet

  - source: fit.py
    name: fit
    product:
        nb: output/nb.html
        model: output/model.pickle

```
<!-- #endmd -->


## Setup your API key

Go to the cloud and setup your key, add your email address:

https://main.d3mpv0f3dqco4e.amplifyapp.com/register

```bash
ploomber cloud set-key $YOUR_API_KEY
```

```bash
ploomber cloud get-key
```

## Run your pipeline
We can get all of our pipeline execution history by running the command below, we can check out if we have anything that was errored out

```bash
ploomber cloud get-pipelines
```
now let's run the sample ml-basic pipeline and see how it's tracked

```python
%%sh --no-raise-error
ploomber build
```

Seeing how a successful pipeline looks like. You can also view the alerting mechanism - check out your email report!

```bash
ploomber cloud get-pipelines latest
```
![working-monitoring](https://ploomber.io/images/doc/monitoring-pipeline.png)

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path('fit.py')
clean = path.read_text()

# add a print statement at the end of 3-clean.py
path.write_text(clean + """
raise ValueError("This is a sample error in the model fit")
""")
```

```python
%%sh --no-raise-error
ploomber build
```

### Check your email
You should have a similar email stating a pipeline errored out and the error trace.

![errored-pip-monitoring](https://ploomber.io/images/doc/monitoring-pipeline.png)

You can also get all of the active pipelines, we'll see only ones that didn't finished yet.

```bash
ploomber cloud get-pipelines active
```

We can also delete errored pipelines if we'd like to for instance we can run the command below to delete the ml pipeline.


```python
%%sh --no-raise-error
ploomber cloud delete-pipeline 9448f7ee-cc90-4e8a-8539-98e2ed0b4061
```

# Conclusion
This short guide allows you to track your pipelines, it's especially relevant when running parallel/long executions and you want to be notified once your workflow has finished.
