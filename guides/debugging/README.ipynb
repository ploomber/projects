    "\n",
    "*This is an in-depth tutorial, for a quick reference,* [click here](https://ploomber.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/debugging.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why debugging pipelines is hard\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging data pipelines is hard because there are three factors involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our code\n",
    "2. Parameters\n",
    "3. Input data\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple cases, pipeline error messages might give us enough information to fix the\n",
    "bug, but in other (which happen more often), we have to inspect the\n",
    "program while running to understand what's going on: see variable values,\n",
    "run a few diagnostic commands, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspecting our program requires us to re-execute it under the same conditions\n",
    "to replicate the crash. Replicating conditions means having the same code, parameters\n",
    "and input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the same code is easy if we know the version (i.e., git hash) running\n",
    "during the crash. Replicating parameters involves more work; one way to approach\n",
    "this is to ensure we always log parameters at the start of every pipeline execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Input data is more complex than it sounds. When our project is not properly assembled as a\n",
    "data pipeline, we might run into issues if we use an incorrect file as input\n",
    "(e.g. reading `/data/some-file.csv` instead of `/data/file.csv`). That's why Ploomber\n",
    "puts a lot of emphasis on declaring products once and automatically propagating them\n",
    "to any downstream consumers, to ensure that there is a single source of truth and we\n",
    "always read if the appropriate file or SQL table from the upstream task.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, replicating error conditions accurately involves some work from your\n",
    "end: 1) recording the project version and 2) input parameters (on every run) and 3) know\n",
    "which input data led to the crash. Once you have these three pieces of information,\n",
    "Ploomber will provide you tools to catch those sneaky bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugger basics\n",
    "\n",
    "A debugger is a program that helps inspect another program for debugging. Python\n",
    "comes with a debugger called\n",
    "[pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few approaches for debugging programs. One approach is line-by-line\n",
    "debugging, which starts our program in *debug* mode so we can easily inspect\n",
    "variables, move to the next line, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important concept to know when debugging is *stack frame*. Simply\n",
    "speaking, stack frames represent the state of our code at a given level.\n",
    "When you write a non-trivial function, it will depend on other\n",
    "functions to work (yours or from third party packages). Each function has its\n",
    "own stack frame which defines the variables that are available to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a program fails, it can do so at different levels (i.e. a\n",
    "different stack frame). Let's see a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def reciprocal(x):\n",
    "    return 1/x\n",
    "\n",
    "def reciprocal_and_multiply(x, y):\n",
    "    return reciprocal(x) * y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two places where things can go wrong in the program\n",
    "above: if we pass `x=0`, the `reciprocal` operation will\n",
    "fail. If we pass `y=None`, the program fails, but it\n",
    "will do so in the `reciprocal_and_multiply` function. For this trivial example,\n",
    "it's easy to see at which level the code breaks but in a real program the source\n",
    "code alone is usually not enough to know. Moving between stack frames can\n",
    "help you find out where the error is coming from."

    "\n",
    "This is a much harder problem because we don't know where to look at! If a bug is originated in task `A` it might propagate to any downstream tasks that use the product from `A` as input, this is why testing is essential. By explicitly checking our data expectations, we increase the chance of catching errors at the source, rather than in a downstream task.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it happens (and trust me, it will), we recommend you to follow a recursive approach: Once you detect the error, the first question to answer is: Which task produced this output? Once you know that, start a line-by-line debugging session (post-mortem won't work because there is no exception!), and carefully check variables to see if you can spot the error.\n",

A full end-to-end run is wasteful but so is an incremental run if `B` has many downstream tasks. For testing purposes, we just care about things going well *until `B`*.

As we mentioned in the previous guide: explicitly stating our data expectations is the way to move forward.\n",
