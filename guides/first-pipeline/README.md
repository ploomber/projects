# Your first Python pipeline

Introductory tutorial to learn the basics of Ploomber.
<!-- end description -->

## Introduction

Ploomber helps you build modular pipelines. A pipeline (or **DAG**) is a group of tasks with a particular execution order, where subsequent (or **downstream** tasks) use previous (or **upstream**) tasks as inputs.

## Pipeline declaration

This example pipeline contains three tasks, `1-get.py`, `2-clean.py`,
and `3-plot.py`; we declare them in a `pipeline.yaml` file:

<!-- #md -->
```yaml
# Content of pipeline.yaml
tasks:
   # source is the code you want to execute (.ipynb also supported)
  - source: 1-get.py
    # products are task's outputs
    product:
      # scripts generate executed notebooks as outputs
      nb: output/1-get.ipynb
      # you can define as many outputs as you want
      data: output/data.csv
    
  - source: 2-clean.py
    product:
      nb: output/2-clean.ipynb
      data: output/clean.csv

  - source: 3-plot.py
    product:
      nb: output/3-plot.ipynb

```
<!-- #endmd -->

**Note:** YAML is a human-readable text format similar to JSON.

**Note:** Ploomber supports Python scripts, Python functions, Jupyter notebooks, R scripts, and SQL scripts.

## Opening `.py` files as notebooks

Ploomber integrates with Jupyter. Among other things, it **allows you to open `.py` files as notebooks** (via `jupytext`).

### How is execution order determined?

Ploomber infers the pipeline structure from your code. For example, to
clean the data, we must get it first; hence, we declare the following in `2-clean.py`:

~~~python
# 2-clean.py

# this tells Ploomber to execute the '1-get' task before '2-clean'
upstream = ['1-get']
~~~

## Plotting the pipeline

```bash
ploomber plot
```

```python
from IPython.display import Image
Image(filename='pipeline.png')
```

You can see that our pipeline has a defined execution order.

**Note:** This is a simple three-task pipeline, but Ploomber can manage arbitrarily complex pipelines and dependencies among tasks.

## Running the pipeline

```bash
# takes a few seconds to finish
ploomber build
```

This pipeline saves all the output in the `output/` directory; we have the output notebooks and data files:

```bash
ls output
```

## Updating the pipeline

Ploomber automatically caches your pipelineâ€™s previous results and only runs tasks that changed since your last execution.

Execute the following to modify the `2-clean.py` script

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path('2-clean.py')
clean = path.read_text()

# add a print statement at the end of 2-clean.py
path.write_text(clean + """
print("hello")
""")
```

Execute the pipeline again:

```bash
# takes a few seconds to finish
ploomber build
```

```python
# restore contents
path.write_text(clean)
```

You'll see that `1-get.py` didn't run because it was not affected by the change!
